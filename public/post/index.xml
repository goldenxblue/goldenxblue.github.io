      <description>I found an interesting decal in the game. At first I thought it was a mesh decal, but I realized I was wrong. I noticed that characters get a red outline when they are near the decal, and the cube VFX in the center also has a red outline.&#xA;This appears to be created using edge detection, with the edge detection implemented in the decal rather than in general post-processing. Here is my attempt to recreate it.</description>

      <description>Unreal Engine has a physically-based shading model for its single-layer water material. Instead of using a predefined water color, it calculates the water color through light scattering and absorption.&#xA;Some tutorials also mentioned this appraoch:&#xA;Yet Another Stylised Water Shader by Remy. Realistic Water Colour in ShaderGraph by eleonora I went through Unreal&amp;rsquo;s shading code and figured the absorption and scattering light calculation part. It&amp;rsquo;s a interesting method so here I am sharing with you if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read code.</description>

      <description>The waterfall is inspired by Genshin Impact&amp;rsquo;s waterfall.&#xA;Typically, we need to set texture tiling manually to prevent unwanted stretching.&#xA;However, there&amp;rsquo;s a trick to achieve automatic texture tiling under certain conditions. Thatis to use object&amp;rsquo;s scale as factors to adjust the tiling. The scale is stored in the model matrix, which is accessible via the unity_ObjectToWorld.&#xA;float objXScale = length( float3(unity_ObjectToWorld[0].x, unity_ObjectToWorld[1].x, unity_ObjectToWorld[2].x) ); float objZScale = length( float3(unity_ObjectToWorld[0].z, unity_ObjectToWorld[1].</description>

      <description>Exposure Value Physical camera use aperture size (f-number), shutter speed, and sensitivity to represent an Exposure Value (EV).&#xA;$$ EV_{100} = \log_2{\frac{N^2}{t}} + \log_2 \frac{S}{100} $$ N = f-number, t = shutter speed in second. Sensitivity is 100 per convention.&#xA;EV100 is a standardized measurement for exposure value, but I don&amp;rsquo;t understand how it actually achieve this &amp;ldquo;standardized measurement&amp;rdquo;. Anyway, keep on.&#xA;In game development, EV is abused by using as a light unit (Lagarde and Rousiers, 27): $$ EV​ = \log_2​​ \frac{L_{\text{avg}} \cdot S}{K}​ $$ $L_{avg}$ = average scene luminance.</description>

      <title>Decal</title>

      <description>There are two types of decals in video games: mesh-based decals and screen space decals. Mesh-based decals are, as the name suggests, basically meshes that stick tightly to an object&amp;rsquo;s surface. Check Fewes&amp;rsquo; MeshDecal for an example. They maintain correct perspective and depth at all angles since they&amp;rsquo;re essentially another opaque object. These work best for decals that need to be viewed from extreme angles, or when depth and perspective are crucial.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the theory and methods behind Tonemapping, it&amp;rsquo;s simply a tool to adjust the color like color grading. But they are not the same thing. Tonemappin&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to conver the High Dynamic Range (HDR) color to Standard Dynamic Range (SDR).&#xA;Video game always uses coor value exceeds the range between 0 and 1, like bloom and or HDR texture. To display these color, Tonemapping is used to remap the color in the post-processing.</description>

      <title>Terrain Blending</title>

      <description>Method A common technique for blending objects with terrain involves using depth as an lerp factor. It usually requires first rendering the terrain and saving its color and depth information to separate textures. Then the objects rendered subsequently use the color and depth texture to blend the terrain and objects.&#xA;Genshin Impact used this method to blend the terrain and stones. But it somehow had weird shadow?&#xA;An enhanced approach to this technique, suggested by Wang in GDC 2023, involves rendering the terrain twice: once in the opaque pass and once in the transparent pass.</description>

      <description>The best explaination about depth in rendering is by Cyanilux.&#xA;Early Depth Test, Alpha Test, Overdraw One example using depth to optimize the rendering is the early depth test. The depth value of the incoming pixel is compared to the existing value in the depth buffer. The depth test passes when the comparison satisfies the depth test function. It skips the pixel shading, otherwise. In this way, the GPU rejects many shading calculation of the occluded objects.</description>

      <description>Refraction is a key optical property of transparent materials like ice, glass, water, and plastic. Snell&amp;rsquo;s law provides the accurate mathematical formula for refraction, but we often avoid implementatin true refraction due to the performance consideration.&#xA;Transparen object&amp;rsquo;s can lead to overdraw, so expensive calculation should be minimized. Additionally, artists typically prefer simpler workflows and are refluctant to work with technical parameters like medium IOR values.&#xA;A common approximation technique for refraction invovles offseting the UV coordinates based on surface normal.</description>

      <description>Secondary maps, or detail maps, allow us to overlay additional textures on top of base textures. It&amp;rsquo;s a common technique to add details on object to make it more visually interesting.&#xA;Rock in video games is often scaled up and placed on terrain to create interesting environments. However, when models are scaled up, their textures are also scaled, resulting blurry and pixlated appearances.&#xA;Detail maps solve this problem by seamlessly tiling additional textures over the base texture, maintaining visual quality in large scales.</description>

      <description>A nice trick I learned from Flogelz!&#xA;To create sphere-like lighting on a quad, we first need to calculate the normal. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we do it&#xA;float2 centerUV = (uv - 0.5) * (-2) float z = sqrt(1.0 - saturate(dot(centerUV, centerUV))); float3 normal = float3(centerUV.x, centerUV.y, z); First we shift the UV coordinates to the center, the calculate the z component of the normal based on UVs as x and y.</description>

      <description>Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s described a color outside of the visible spectrum in his novel Color Out of Space. This color was emitted from an alien creature which destroyed an area later in the. Even though the idea of a color that is outside the spectrum sounds illogical, but magenta is such color. We can see magenta, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist in the spectrum.&#xA;Magenta is loosely defined as purplish-red or reddish-purple. In color wheels of the RGB, it is located exactly midway between red and blue.</description>
